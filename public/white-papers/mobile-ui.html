<div class="description">This project was an experiment in mobile first design. The goal was to include dynamic data in the most intuitive and least intrusive way possible. I combined simple flat-design with contextual buttons, and interesting css animations.</div>

        <div class="text">Mobile design requires a balance between content and usability. By designing the pages from the ground up with smaller screens in mind itâ€™s much easier to deliver a positive user experience, without feeling like the content has simply been removed.</div>

        <div class="text">Animations can make a tremendous difference in how the user rates the responsiveness and usability of a site. Seamless animations create a feeling of performance. There are a few quarks (as of writing this) with mobile css, making this test fairly useful in understand draw rates and hardware acceleration. </div>

        <div class="text">Because mobile screens have such limited space, it is generally a good idea to design in such a way that content can be delivered seamlessly from off screen. </div>
