<div class="description">
Culinary Web Solution was designed to allow small restaurants to build a website without any coding ability. I created this project before the widespread success of website like Wix or Squarespace. While more limited in scope, culinary web solutions was my first at attempt at a SaaS model. It allows some basic design customization, and content editing. It was designed to deploy on a VPS, and offer a complete hosting and development solution.

        <div class="text">The menu system is basic in term of flexibility when compared with a more recent project like <a href="#/white-paper/true-menu"><span>TrueMenu</span></a>. The client can use system to create categories, and items, or set prices and descriptions. It was created to display the result as simple html without allowing for complex options. Sorting is handled by a drag and drop system.</div>

    	<div class="title">Style Selection and Customization</div>
        <div class="text">The user has the ability to select a template style, and customize that style to some extent. The server essentially clones the template and identifies its index page as primary. This allows the user to easily migrate from one style to another with only a few clicks. </div>
